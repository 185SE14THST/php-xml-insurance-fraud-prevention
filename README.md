This repo contains the samples that demonstrate a 'detecting fraudulent form-based activity based on user definitions'. This sample would apply to industries with high transactional portals such as insurance, banking and ecommerce. With further development the sample may show:
* Integration with existing company data via REST API.
* Styled charts and tables for relavent C-Level reporting
* A full algorithm for defining and detecting 'fraud' anomolies.
* Responsive design, 'no-blink' pages.

> **Note:** If you are unfamiliar with Git and GitHub, you can download the entire collection as a
